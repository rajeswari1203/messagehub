# message-hub-samples
IBM Message Hub is a scalable, distributed, high throughput message bus to unite your on-premise and off-premise cloud technologies. You can wire micro-services together using open protocols, connect stream data to analytics to realise powerful insight and feed event data to multiple applications to react in real time.

This repository is for samples which interact with the Message Hub service. Currently, there are samples for Node.js and Java; information and instructions regarding the use of these samples can be found in their respective directories.

For more information regarding IBM Message Hub, [view the documentation on Bluemix](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/MessageHub/index.html).

__Important Note__: The samples in this repository will create topic(s) on your behalf - creating a topic incurs a fee. For more information, view the README files in each part of the
repository and consult the Bluemix documentation if necessary.
